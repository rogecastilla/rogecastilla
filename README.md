- 👋 Hi, I’m @rogecastilla
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in engineering problems and the application of coding from basic programming to machine learning to more efficiently solve those issues.
- my relevant ecperince coding has been trough biomedical engineering with signal proccesing, model development, and object detection. I am however interested in any challenge that involves the use of physics, chemistry and/or mathematical first principles to be resolved.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MatLab and Python, I also currenlty study biomedical engineering. I am looking to learn a few more languages to expand my areas of competence and 
- work with a wider range of possible solutions.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on repositories that are working to solve or help improve healthcare quality or interesting prompts and challenges, I'm always 
- happy to work on a challenge!
- 
- 📫 How to reach me? I can always be messaged here or feel free to email me at rogecastilla.rc@gmail.com for more prompt communication!
