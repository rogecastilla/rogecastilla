👋 Hi, I’m Rogelio Castilla, a biomedical engineer and founder of Innovavision Solutions, where I deliver CAD modeling, reverse engineering, simulation (FEA/CFD), and rapid-prototyping for industrial and R&D clients.

⚙️ My experience spans mechanical and biomedical systems from piston and pump assemblies to microneedle molds and wearable/implantable devices. I integrate Fusion 360, SolidWorks, OpenFOAM, and Python to bridge design, simulation, and manufacturability.

🧠 I explore smart materials, soft robotics, and biohybrid systems across flexible bioelectronics, microfluidics, and additive manufacturing. I’m especially interested in how mechanical design + materials behavior enable adaptive, accessible, biologically integrated tech. Lately I’ve been developing a modified Ender 3 Pro for viscoelastic material extrusion, combining low-cost AM, materials science, and open, citizen-driven experimentation -- into a hands-on approach to making bioprinting, and soft-matter research (or just fun experimentation and personal projects) more accessible.

🚀 Past collaborations include NASA Micro-G’s lunar marker, a Stafford–Leonov UAV design, flexible bioelectronics for improved implants, and biohybrid tissue-engineering systems for actuation and disease modeling. I’m passionate about how adaptive materials and mechanics drive innovation in healthcare and space systems.

🤝 Open to collaborations in simulation, device design, or smart-material applications.
